How to use sheep livepatch feature
==================================
1. enable livepatch feature before make
    ./configure --enable-livepatch

    NOTE: livepatch cannot be used with tracer

2. prepare a text patch
   e.g. following is a patch in diff format named hello.patch

    diff --git a/sheep/vdi.c b/sheep/vdi.c
    index d65b4a4..3f862e1 100644
    --- a/sheep/vdi.c
    +++ b/sheep/vdi.c
    @@ -625,6 +625,8 @@ int vdi_create(const struct vdi_iocb *iocb, uint32_t *new_vid)
            struct vdi_info info = {};
            int ret;

    +    sd_info("hello, livepatch");
    +
            ret = vdi_lookup(iocb, &info);
            switch (ret) {
            case SD_RES_SUCCESS:

3. use livepatch-build to convert the text patch to a livepatch
    first see how to use livepatch-build
    # livepatch-build
    Usage: /usr/sbin/livepatch-build <patch> <sheepdog-tree>
    patch        : [patch-name].patch file
    sheepdog-tree: source code directory for sheepdog-ng

    # livepatch-build hello.patch sheepdog-ng
    entering sheep directory
    building patched sheep...
      CC       vdi.o
      CCLD     sheep
    Built sheep
    building orig sheep...
      CC       vdi.o
      CCLD     sheep
    Built sheep
    extracting changed functions...
    building live patch...
    created patch: /home/ghc/.livepatch/hello-patch.o
    cleanup...
    NOTE: patch stuff is cached @ /home/ghc/.livepatch
    Done

    now you have a livepatch hello-patch.o

4. install the livepatch
    there is a patch/ directory right under the meta data path of your running sheep,
    just run
    # sudo cp hello-patch.o
    then the livepatch can be used by sheep

5. use dog livepatch patch to patch your sheep
    # dog livepatch patch hello-patch.o

    NOTE: here just give the name of livepatch, not the path, sheep will look for
    the patch in patch/ directory

6. check result
    the hello.patch above changes the behavior of command "dog vdi create",
    so just run
    # dog vdi create test 1g
    then check the sheep.log for "hello, livepatch"

7 use dog livepatch status to check patched livepatches
    # dog livepatch status
    Patches         Functions
    hello-patch.o   [vdi_create]

8 use dog livepatch unpatch to unpatch your sheep
    # dog livepatch unpatch hello-patch.o
